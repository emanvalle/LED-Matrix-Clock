# LED-Matrix-Display
This project involves a 32 x 16 LED matrix display connected to an arduino. Using the arduino and an RTC, the display shows the current time as well as the date. The Arduino also has timer functions which allow it to set a 15 or 30 min timer. There is also a game mode on the display which runs the game Snake.
